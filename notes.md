\# NumPy Notes -Day 8



\## What is NumPy

NumPy is a numerical computing library used for fast mathematical operations on arrays and matrices using optimized C- level implementation.



\## ndarray vs Python list

python lists store elements as references.

NumPy arrays store fixed - type values in contiguous memory , making them faster.



\## Shape , axis , dtype

Shape defines the dimensions of an array .

Axis =0 refers to column - wise operations , Axis =1 refers to row -wise operations .

dtype controls the data type and memory usage.



\## Why vectorization matters in ML 

Machine learning works on large batches of data .

Vectorized operations allow fast computation of gradients and distances.



\## When not to use NumPy

NumPy is not suitable for string - heavy tasks or highly dynamic object data.
